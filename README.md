# landing-page
A beautiful landing page constructed using pure HTML and CSS.

This project really challenged my knowledge on flexbox. Initially, I had a vague understanding of flexbox and didn't really understand how to harness it to make good looking layouts. This project forced me to overcome that bump and I now have a much better understanding of flexbox and how to use it to make a good looking layout.
